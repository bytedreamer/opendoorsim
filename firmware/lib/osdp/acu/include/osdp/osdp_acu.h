/* osdp_acu — Access Control Unit (controller) state machine.
 *
 * Counterpart of osdp::pd. The ACU initiates commands toward one or
 * more PDs sharing a half-duplex bus, manages per-PD sequence numbers,
 * times out unanswered commands, and routes accepted replies to the
 * application via callbacks.
 *
 * Like osdp::pd, this layer remains freestanding: no malloc, no
 * globals, no I/O of its own. The consumer supplies a transport (RS-485
 * UART, TCP, in-process loopback for tests) via a callback vtable plus
 * reply / timeout / SC-event handlers.
 *
 * Capabilities:
 *
 *   - Caller-allocated PD slot array (no allocation, multi-PD supported).
 *   - Explicit send_command API; the application drives polling.
 *   - One outstanding command per PD at a time. Issuing a second
 *     command while a reply is pending returns OSDP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED
 *     (the current "busy" sentinel; future iterations may queue).
 *   - Sequence number management per spec 5.9 Table 2: starts at 0
 *     for the first command on a fresh PD slot, then 1→2→3→1→…
 *     Successful reply advances; timeout retains the SQN so a retry
 *     re-uses it.
 *   - Reply timeout = OSDP_ACU_REPLY_TIMEOUT_MS (200 ms, spec 5.7).
 *   - Per-PD online tracking: a PD is online while it has produced a
 *     reply within OSDP_ACU_OFFLINE_TIMEOUT_MS (8 s, spec 5.7).
 *   - Optional Secure Channel: per-PD opt-in via osdp_acu_set_pd_scbk*
 *     plus a shared AES + RNG vtable bound on the ACU. See "Secure
 *     Channel lifecycle" below.
 *
 * ---- Secure Channel lifecycle ------------------------------------------
 *
 * Each PD slot has an `sc_phase` field tracking the handshake state:
 *
 *     IDLE → AWAITING_CCRYPT → AWAITING_RMAC_I → ESTABLISHED
 *      ↑__________________________________________|
 *                   (on session loss)
 *
 * The application drives the transition IDLE → AWAITING_CCRYPT by
 * calling osdp_acu_start_sc_handshake(pd_addr, use_default_key). The
 * ACU sends osdp_CHLNG immediately and tick() drives the rest:
 *
 *   start_sc_handshake → emits SCS_11 CHLNG with RND.A
 *   tick consumes SCS_12 CCRYPT
 *     ⊕ validates Client Cryptogram
 *     ⊕ on match, emits SCS_13 SCRYPT with Server Cryptogram
 *     ⊕ on mismatch, fires HANDSHAKE_FAILED, returns to IDLE
 *   tick consumes SCS_14 RMAC_I
 *     ⊕ checks sec_blk_data[0] (0x01 ok / 0xFF PD-rejected SCRYPT)
 *     ⊕ validates Initial R-MAC against locally-derived expected
 *     ⊕ on success: seeds session.last_outbound_mac =
 *                   session.last_inbound_mac = Initial R-MAC,
 *                   transitions to ESTABLISHED, fires ESTABLISHED
 *     ⊕ on any failure: fires HANDSHAKE_FAILED, returns to IDLE
 *
 * CCRYPT and RMAC_I are consumed silently by the handshake state
 * machine — they never appear in the application's reply_cb. The
 * application only learns the outcome through sc_event_cb.
 *
 * Once ESTABLISHED, every osdp_acu_send_command on that slot is
 * automatically wrapped — there is no per-command opt-out. Inbound
 * SCS_16 / SCS_18 replies are unwrapped before being delivered via
 * reply_cb (always plaintext to the application).
 *
 * ---- Session-loss conditions -------------------------------------------
 *
 * An established session terminates (slot returns to IDLE; the next
 * command on that slot goes plaintext until the application
 * re-handshakes) on any of these events:
 *
 *   • A SCS_16 / SCS_18 reply has a valid CRC but its MAC fails to
 *     verify (spec D.1.4: "encryption synchronization has been lost").
 *   • A non-BUSY plaintext reply arrives during ESTABLISHED (D.1.4:
 *     "any message sent without a SCB other than osdp_BUSY terminates
 *     the session").
 *   • A reply arrives with sequence number 0 during ESTABLISHED (5.9:
 *     "a PD may respond with SQN zero to indicate the ACU shall reset
 *     the sequence including clearing any secure channel session").
 *   • The PD goes silent for OSDP_ACU_OFFLINE_TIMEOUT_MS (5.7).
 *     Encryption synchronization can't be assumed across multi-second
 *     silence.
 *
 * Each fires OSDP_ACU_SC_EVENT_SESSION_LOST. If the same offline
 * timeout fires while the slot is mid-handshake (AWAITING_CCRYPT or
 * AWAITING_RMAC_I) the event is OSDP_ACU_SC_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED
 * instead — there was nothing established to lose.
